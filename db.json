                "description": "The theme of unrequited love is interesting and from someone like Karan johar, it was expected much more! The movie has moments, typical of a Karan johar movie and it delights you, coupled with great music and Ranbir Kapoor's strong performance but those moments are very few and they get diluted in an otherwise collection of scenes that felt like was written to please the younger generation.The major problem is the story, the Anushka and Ranbir's conflict is stretched too much and the final resolution is very underwhelming and a cliche. Also, the characters are one tone throughout the movie and by the end, you don't care about them in any way. The final nail on the coffin is Anushka's cancer, like seriously, its the most cliche plot point of Bollywood and has been used more than anything else, expected something better than this in 2016.The movie was just badly written and could have been made a lot better if the story was a bit more thought out. Watch it only for some good emotional scenes, awesome music, and Ranbir Kapoor's performance but despite all of these, its really tough to like this film."

It is different from routine love stories. A powerful message of an ordinary human with a powerful expression of unorthodox. Coming to cinematography beautiful scenic locations with awesome camera work.Literally an unconventional experiment to be watched for its writing & making !!! Second half goes for Ranbir and Deepika is cute as always.\nAt last these types of movies regain faith about Bollywood. We can also do it Hats off >>>>>> Amazed"

                "description": "Yeh Jawaani hai Deewani is a refreshing take on the lives of the youth(of varied types)-their needs,their aspirations,their madness. Inspite of being 3+ hours,it never felt like a long film. It is a movie with a lot of flair,adventure and madness, as you would expect from the title.\n The acting cast is mouth-watering. Ranbir Kapoor as Bunny is brilliant. He plays a character who loves to have all the fun, wants to live life at a fast pace and has this quirky ambition of visiting all the beautiful places in the world. Good job Ranbir, great acting skills and mind-blowing dancing skills that is always fun viewing. Deepike Padukone as Naina shines as an actor and shows she is more than just good looks with a beautiful rendition of a nerdy girl who is looking to break all inhibitions. I think she captured a studious,unsatisfied and conflicted girl perfectly. Kalki as Aditi exceeded my expectations. It was a treat watching Aditya Roy Kapoor who always lit up the screen whenever he was present."
