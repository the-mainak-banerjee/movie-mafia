        "description": "The theme of unrequited love is interesting and from someone like Karan johar, it was expected much more! The movie has moments, typical of a Karan johar movie and it delights you, coupled with great music and Ranbir Kapoor's strong performance but those moments are very few and they get diluted in an otherwise collection of scenes that felt like was written to please the younger generation.The major problem is the story, the Anushka and Ranbir's conflict is stretched too much and the final resolution is very underwhelming and a cliche. Also, the characters are one tone throughout the movie and by the end, you don't care about them in any way. The final nail on the coffin is Anushka's cancer, like seriously, its the most cliche plot point of Bollywood and has been used more than anything else, expected something better than this in 2016.The movie was just badly written and could have been made a lot better if the story was a bit more thought out. Watch it only for some good emotional scenes, awesome music, and Ranbir Kapoor's performance but despite all of these, its really tough to like this film."
