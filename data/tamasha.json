        "description": "Superb direction, superb movie, superb acting and yes Imtiaz Ali did it again. Not a Romeo Juliet movie like love, separating and then happy ending. It is different from routine love stories. A powerful message of an ordinary human with a powerful expression of unorthodox. Coming to cinematography beautiful scenic locations with awesome camera work.Literally an unconventional experiment to be watched for its writing & making !!! Second half goes for Ranbir and Deepika is cute as always.\nAt last these types of movies regain faith about Bollywood. We can also do it Hats off >>>>>> Amazed"
